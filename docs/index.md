# FRC Java Command Codebase

This codebase was developed for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition game by team members on Team 5940 B.R.E.A.D. This codebase follows the "command based" template provided by WPI. The code is (at a high level) organized into subsystems, commands and the main robot. Subsystems are things like a drivetrain, wrist, elevator or or intake. These commands have methods for setting motor speeds, getting information, or anything else relating to the subsystem. Subsystems must also contain a default command to be run, if none other are currently reserving the subsystem. (In our case, that's often an arcade drive command for telop) Commands are blocks of code that are run, "reserve" subsystems for their exclusive use, and are used to move the elevator to a set height, intake/outtake, or do any other basic actions. These actions can be organized into larger "Command groups," which are blocks of commands that run together (either in parallel or sequentially) to produce a more complex action like "score a cargo."
